## Imports and loading the dataset

Let's start the necessary `import`s for our code. We will use the breast cancer dataset in this tutorial.

```python
# Load the necessary python libraries
from sklearn import preprocessing, decomposition
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_graphviz
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine, load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, KFold, cross_validate
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import graphviz
from graphviz import Source
from IPython.display import SVG
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import scipy
import os

%matplotlib inline
plt.style.use('bmh')
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 14,
                     'xtick.labelsize' : 14,
                     'ytick.labelsize' : 14,
                     'figure.figsize' : [12,8],
                     })
```
